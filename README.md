# WebAuthn Typescript

### Overview

_The WebAuthn specification has two interesting parts for Web Developers:_

-   Registering a new user in your app and verifying logins of said user. In the code sample, you can find the server-side implementation of these steps in src -> authentication -> signup.ts / verify.ts.
-   All client-side (web browser) related implementation can be found in pages -> webauthn.js.
-   Click through these files and read the comments to learn about the general implementation flow.
-   If you want to dig deeper, many of the comments already have references to the part of the specification that they are implementing.
